<h2>If people are the bread, conferences are the butter.</h2>

<p>Conferences bring together the whole Florida district of Unitarian Universalist
	Beacon youth and advisors. A conference is a safe place to make <strong>life-long
	friendships</strong> with youth and adults alike, and foster <strong>positive relationships</strong>
	and <strong>personal growth.</strong></p>

<p>There are several types of conferences that may occur, and all of them are
	for their own unique purpose.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>All-Age Conference:</strong> A conference where youth ages 12 –
		20 can attend, its workshops are generally geared to a specific theme.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Trans-In Conference:</strong> A conference intended for the new
		members of Beacon, youth ages 12 – 14 (or those who have attended three
		or less conferences) may attend. This is a more structured conference,
		intended help involve new youth, and acclimate them to the idea and
		environment of Beacon.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Social Action Conference:</strong> At a social-action conference,
		there will be a planned activity to better society. Projects ranging from
		cleaning rivers, to helping at homeless shelters – these are a great way
		to be involved and help the community.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Youth Caucus:</strong> Youth Caucus is where major decisions and
		elections are had. Any member of Beacon can be elected to any of the
		several available positions. This conference is business-related, and
		very important for those interested in being more interested in Beacon.</li>
</ul>
